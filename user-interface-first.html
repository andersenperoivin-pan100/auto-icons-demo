<h1>Poster Paper 2025</h1>

<strong>The approach to designing a usable user interface metaphor extension for an desktop application or web browser based software with or without a data layer might not be a simple case. 
There is clearly a need to study further how users interact and what they could wrongly click if the user interface on-screen software is to decide all user actions. Also software is maybe patented or licensed, and history has shown that law suits could pursuit those who copy user interface elements and distribute it as a part of their package or include them in their software user interface.</strong>

<p>This forthcoming paper is tentatetively a potential for further studies into the symbols that occur in usability design and its on-screen usages or ellaborate on the needs for learning on all systems and the need for human skill in systems use - the usable system must have a user and verbal or written instructions of use the author argues must be provided for users.
Or is a user interface design able to be intuitive and usable with tutoring on screen in some way? The author experienced that attempting and failing was not as good as having schooled and tutored educational learning processes to understand - also experience was shared in groups and collaborated over over time and adult and seniors had more knowledge than beginner level designers, perhaps. A great question is - could senior citizens and the upgrowing or middle aged population learn from each other and together create more usable systems?</p>

<p>In the study, I as an author draw user interface elements using KolourPaint open source software, explore on line and off line coding software and attempt to land an as legal intranet user interface as possible, and the starting icons are traffic lights, an icon resembling the stapled bill that is for instance given from a mechanical workshop and a green car seen from the side, and a wheel. The use case scenario could be the change of wheel set when the roads are icy or when a wheel is punctaded on the road. Also it could be training for those who needs to change a wheel as this was not part of certification for driving on the roads when I took my driving test.</p>

<p>The development process is driven by a method of designing the user interface icons, then attempting more studies to see where they can be used in an intranet environment and insurance is key to where the monetary agreements could be attempted solved in a world where the wheels are important for the car and the driver not to slide off the road in a cold environment or other faults leading to damage to those on the inside or the outside of the vehicle on the road and on its way from and to destinations.</p>

<p>Many questions comes to mind and as a former student of user interaction and operating systems first year graduate, I see that the license of software may be more developed than open sourced alternatives, or cost to develop also developing systems and countries act as potential for newly started startups to legally input screens to intranet more secure ways of dealing with accidents that may occur or driver faults, and also those faults that might lead to claims from auto customers in traffic and also in countries not fully paperless.</p>

<p>The software method used has been to design icons of a fixed quadratic size, sorted in to folders and the most popular version handling system for open source "GIT" has been used to remember and state those changes that has been made, then a web browser interface is being designed testing during development on input without a clear methodology - almost as "hacking" an interface to probe for solutions that might have been made in the past with user interface elements from the non licensed pixeled search engines without the knowledge of software licensing, but not to license the software but to solve real world issues</p>

<p>Following are the icons I have created and they are showing a flow of a thought imaginary flow for a user interface design or maybe digital learning of the traffic flow in the roads, where the car varies and the driver is licensed to drive some cars and have some training in handling the situation of changing a wheel or there is no flow maybe, just a user interface - at this point the use of the symbols are uncertain. Maybe the symbols can be used in analysis or inside a vehicle.</p>

<p>As one can see, the first icon resembles a red light, and this means stop. Then, the next symbol resembles a yellow light and this means wait. The next is a green symbol and on this the signal means that the driver can drive carefully. It then is drawed a symbol of a wheel, and this could punctuate. A human is needed for the vehicle both to drive it and to repair for instance the punctuated wheel. A paper slip is an icon, and this is billing for service or road side help, and can be placed in the vehicle. The last symbol is the car with an exclamation mark over the front, where the engine is traditionally placed.</p>

<p>This post graduate ellaboration and these icons and their use case scenarios could be inside a vehicle not in a flow of events as indicators or in a workshop and are not new knowledge - developing countries have always imported from industrially leading nations and skilled workers and employees are <b>crucial</b> for the well being of a society, I conclude mid term and review our education as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>depending on solid, safe and <i>native</i> neighbours</li>
  <li>care systems and planning of weekly activities and daily but also <b>crucial</b> maintenance and other functions when the standard week has ended</li>
  <li>security of assets and payment systems for trade between the companies and coorporativities that are assisting these natives worldwide</li>
</ul>
